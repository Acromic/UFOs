## Overview of analysis
An in-depth analysis of UFO sightings and allowing users to filter for multiple criterias at the same time.

## Results
The user is given 5 search functions. You can manually input the date, search by city, state, country and even the shape.
This allows the users a more refined search. 

## Summary
One drawback i found is that the search info typed needs to be exact. Upper and lower case also need to be specific.
I recommend refactoring the code to where if someone were to type "spring" for instance, you'd get a hit for "spring valley".
I'd also recommend fixing the upper and lowercase issue. That could easily lead to a bad experience.
